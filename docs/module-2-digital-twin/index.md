# Module 2: The Digital Twin

## Physics Simulation & High-Fidelity Rendering

Welcome to **Module 2: The Digital Twin**. In this module, you'll learn to simulate robots in virtual environments before deploying to real hardware.

### What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual replica of your robot that:
- Accurately simulates physics (gravity, friction, collisions)
- Reproduces sensor data (cameras, lidar, IMU)
- Allows safe testing of algorithms
- Eliminates expensive hardware failures

### Why Two Simulators?

**Gazebo** - Physics accuracy
- Precise physics engine (bullet, ODE)
- Lightweight and fast
- Perfect for algorithm development
- ROS 2 native integration

**Unity** - Visual realism
- Photorealistic rendering
- Human-robot interaction scenarios
- Semantic scene understanding
- Real-time performance

### Module Topics

This module covers:

1. **Gazebo Simulation** - Physics engine, world setup, sensor simulation
2. **Unity Simulation** - 3D modeling, humanoid in realistic environments
