# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

## ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System**. In this module, you'll learn ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that enables all robot components to communicate and work together.

### What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the "nervous system" of your humanoid robot. Just like your biological nervous system coordinates your brain with your body, ROS 2 coordinates:
- AI algorithms (the brain)
- Sensor inputs (eyes, ears, touch)
- Motor controllers (muscles)
- Real-time communication

### Module Topics

This module covers:

1. **ROS 2 Architecture** - Nodes, Topics, Services, and Messages
2. **Your First ROS 2 Node** - Publish velocity commands and read sensor data
3. **URDF Robot Description** - XML format for describing humanoid structure

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will:

✅ Understand the ROS 2 distributed computing model  
✅ Create Publisher/Subscriber nodes  
✅ Implement Services for request-response patterns  
✅ Write a URDF file describing a humanoid robot  
✅ Simulate robot movement with ROS 2 commands  

### Key Concepts

**Nodes**: Independent processes that perform specific tasks
**Topics**: Data streams where nodes publish and subscribe
**Services**: Request-response communication patterns
**Messages**: Data structures that nodes exchange
**URDF**: XML format for robot descriptions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ programming experience
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming
- Linux/Ubuntu familiarity

### Next Steps

1. Start with [ROS 2 Fundamentals](1-ros2-fundamentals.md)
2. Progress to [Your First ROS 2 Node](2-first-ros2-node.md)
3. Learn [URDF Robot Description](3-urdf-robot-description.md)
4. Then move to **Module 2: The Digital Twin**
