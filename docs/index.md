# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Master the Future of AI in the Physical World

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This course bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and physical embodiment—where digital brains meet robotic bodies.

### What You'll Learn

By completing this course, you will:

✅ **Understand Physical AI** principles and embodied intelligence  
✅ **Master ROS 2** - the robotic nervous system  
✅ **Simulate robots** with Gazebo physics engine  
✅ **Create high-fidelity environments** with Unity  
✅ **Develop with NVIDIA Isaac** - advanced perception  
✅ **Build Vision-Language-Action systems** - voice-to-action control  
✅ **Deploy the capstone** - autonomous humanoid with voice commands  

### Course Modules

**Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**
- ROS 2 middleware architecture
- Nodes, Topics, and Services
- URDF robot description
- Real-time control systems

**Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**
- Physics simulation with Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering in Unity
- Sensor simulation and testing
- Environment building

**Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**
- Photorealistic simulation
- Synthetic data generation
- Hardware-accelerated perception
- Nav2 path planning

**Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**
- Voice-to-text with Whisper
- Vision understanding with CLIP
- LLM planning with GPT-4
- Robot action execution

### Capstone Project

Build an autonomous humanoid that:
1. Listens to voice commands
2. Understands natural language
3. Plans action sequences
4. Executes tasks in simulation
5. Verifies completion

**Pipeline:**
```
"Pick up the red ball" →
Whisper transcription →
